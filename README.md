# SHOPPING CART #

I tried to use RTM to manage my shopping list, but it never worked right from my nokia.

So I made my own todo list.

It is navigatable from the keyboard of a nokia e63.

Calculates a running total of your purchases so I know if I can use that 20 NIS cupon from yesh.

Also shows the aversage price that you paid for an item on your list so you know if it is a good sale or not.
